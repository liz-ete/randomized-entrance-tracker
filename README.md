# ALTTP Entrance Tracker

Entrance tracker for [A Link to The Past Randomizer](https://alttpr.com/en). It aims to be a web-based tribute to Seph's Tracker (my favorite one).

This project uses React and HTML5 Canvas as a little experiment made just for funsies.

## How to use

Browsers might block the tracker from opening since it uses a pop up window. Please make sure you allow pop up windows.

Right Click: Removes a location from the map.

Left Click: Opens the menu with the available markers.

Clicking on the Portal icon (bottom right icon) switches maps between Light and Dark Worlds.

## TODO:

- Add missing assets.
